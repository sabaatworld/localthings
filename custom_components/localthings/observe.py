        href rather than handing it to StateCache.apply_rep verbatim --
        apply_rep does a full replace, and Samsung devices don't always
        repeat every field on every update (issue #27: a /mode/vs/0
        OBSERVE notify -- and, on at least one Bespoke fridge, even the
        /device/0 sweep entry for that href -- can carry just `modes`,
        omitting `supportedOptions`/`supportedModes` entirely). A full
        replace would silently wipe fields a select entity's
        exists_fn/options_field gates on the moment one partial update
        comes through, even though nothing about the device's actual
        supported options changed.

        `_is_alarms_href` is the one exception to that merge (issue #348):
        /alarms/vs/0's `items` array is always sent as a complete
        snapshot of every currently-active alarm, never a partial delta
        -- confirmed by a live `read_resource` GET returning `{}` (no
        `items` key at all) the moment a washer's board actually clears
        an alarm, which entity.py already documents as this resource's
        normal no-alarm shape. Merging that `{}` onto the prior rep the
        same way as everywhere else silently kept the stale `items`
        entry forever: an absent key merges as "unchanged" everywhere
        else, but on this href absent specifically means "cleared".
        Every family that exposes an alarm sensor shares this href
        (common.ALARMS, range_hood's own copy), so this is a full
        replace for all of them, not a washer-specific carve-out.

        `apply()` is the sole path StateCache mutations flow through in
        this component (poll, sweep, and OBSERVE notify all funnel here),
        so `_cache_lock` serializes the read-then-write across those
        threads (DTLS reader for notifies, executor threads for poll/
        sweep) -- without it, two concurrent updates for the same href
        could each read the same prior rep and the second writer would
        silently lose the first's fields, reintroducing the exact bug
        this merge fixes.

        `source == 'optimistic'` always bypasses the settle gate below,
        even while this href is already settling from an earlier write.
        Several independent selects can share one href -- issue #9's washer
        packs cycle, detergent, and softener settings onto the same
        /course/vs/0 -- so a second, different write to the same href
        while the first's settle window is still open (up to
        _POST_TIMEOUT_S + _POLL_TIMEOUT_S, tens of seconds -- see
        coordinator.async_send_command) is an expected, normal sequence,
        not a stale echo of the first write. Gating it the same as a
        poll/sweep/observe update would silently drop the user's own
        second selection from the cache until the first write's guard
        happened to expire, i.e. the exact symptom this guard exists to
        prevent, just relocated to whichever write loses the race.

        Partial sources (observe notifies from a physical-panel change,
        optimistic appliers of this integration's own writes) merge
        recursively: dicts recurse, options[] merges by token prefix and
        items[] by item id, everything else replaces. A panel change
        arrives carrying only its own token, and a verbatim array replace
        would wipe every sibling setting to unknown until the next full
        poll. Poll/sweep/direct reads stay on the shallow top-level merge
        so a full read can still retire stale tokens.

        An href found stale on `STALE_SWEEPS_TO_FALLBACK` sweeps in a row

        /temperatures/vs/0 through a preheat (issue #507).

        This never changes mode or subscriptions. The sweep already
        re-applies the full /device/0 result to the cache every cycle
        regardless of mode, so a missed notify never leaves data stale
        beyond one sweep interval — there's nothing to correct here. And
        a still-live OBSERVE session should never be torn down over a
        data-drift inference: some resources (e.g. an alarm's derived
        "triggeredTime") appear to update without ever emitting a notify
        even when the channel is otherwise perfectly healthy, so treating
        a mismatch as proof of channel death produces false positives.

        The return value lets the caller respond more cheaply: without
        an activity signal there's no way to tell "idle device, healthy
        channel, nothing to notify about" from "dead channel, nothing
        gets through" — both look the same here. So instead of guessing,
        the coordinator uses a discrepancy as a trigger for extra hot/warm
        subpolls this cycle (see `_run_subpolls`'s `force` parameter) —
        a bounded, self-limiting response to a channel that's gone silent
        for a reason OTHER than a reconnect (e.g. the device's OBSERVE
        relay loses its internet connection while the local DTLS session
        stays up), without tearing down subscriptions that will recover
