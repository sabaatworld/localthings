        means the next restart names the device fully instead of renaming it
        again once a poll lands.

        `device_key` is what the registries are keyed on; `serial` is stored

        `ocf_device_id` is the `di` this poll actually proved, recorded

        only has to have recorded the value by the time they land.

        `mac` is treated the same way, and for the same reason: half the

        reads none must not discard what another one did (issue #469).

        the session dead. Defer until `_POLL_TIMEOUT_LIMIT` consecutive
        timeouts pile up. Any other exception reconnects immediately.

        A recent OBSERVE notify no longer defers anything or resets the
        count (issue #507): a range kept pushing notifies on a session that
        had stopped answering requests, which stretched the outage instead
        of ending it. Only a sweep that gets through resets the count.

        That includes `SessionClosedError`, which is the point: before
        smartthings-local 0.1.6, a reader thread that had actually died was
        indistinguishable from a slow transfer -- both surfaced here only as
        a `TimeoutError`, so this tolerance was the only thing standing
        between a truly dead session and a reconnect, worst case about
        `_POLL_TIMEOUT_LIMIT` poll cycles (~2 minutes at the default 30s
        interval). 0.1.6 confirms reader death directly and raises a
        ConnectionError subclass for it instead, which isn't a TimeoutError
        and so skips this tolerance entirely -- a genuinely dead session now
        reconnects on the very first occurrence. Intended (see this repo's
        README, "Known device behavior"), not a regression, but a real
        change in observed reconnect timing for that one failure mode.
