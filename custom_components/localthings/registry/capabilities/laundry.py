"""Capabilities shared across the laundry family (washer, dryer, dishwasher).

Anything here is bound by more than one laundry registry, so it lives in one
place instead of being copied per family. Device-type-specific controls (wash
temperature, dry level, dishwasher storm-wash, etc.) stay in washer.py /
dryer.py / dishwasher.py; only the genuinely shared laundry surface is here.

Generic OCF controls that aren't laundry-specific (power, kids-lock, remote
control, energy meter) live in common.py, not here.

Resource hrefs seen across laundry dumps:
  /doorled/light/vs/0   -> DOOR_LED (door LED brightness / night light)
  /settings/sound/*/vs/0-> SOUND_MODE / SOUND_VOLUME
  /buzzersound/vs/0     -> BUZZER_SOUND (buzzer + optional finish chime)
  /course/vs/0          -> the cycle select + per-family course options
  /wm/editcourse/vs/0   -> live editCourseList that drives the cycle options
  /wm/jobbeginingstatus/vs/0 -> JOB_BEGINNING_STATUS

Door-LED keys use NO `x.com.samsung.da.` prefix -- `setBrightness` /
`setNightLight` -- preserved exactly as they appear in the OCF resource rep.

#
#   <hdr:1 nibble> ( <course:1> ( <kind:nibble><default:nibble> <mask:1> )* )*
#
# The header is the group count, so it states the record width: 1 + 2*hdr
# bytes. True on all 17 dumps here, across six distinct widths, and it
# reproduces the codes the old smallest-that-parses scan derived on every
# one of them -- see _course_records, which keeps that scan as a fallback.
#
# The mask indexes that option's own supported<Option> list, and so does
# the default nibble -- but into the list, not into the mask: a dishwasher
# reports default 0 with a mask allowing only index 1. It is one byte, so
# it cannot address past index 7: four boards carry an 11- or 13-entry
# supportedDryTime, and none of them carries a group for it.
#
# Five kinds are named: 0x8 water temperature, 0x9 rinse and 0xA spin from a
# WW6500 panel reading plus a list-length argument (the reading alone cannot
# separate rinse from spin), 0xD dry from a DV5000T's, and 0xE dry time from
# the DV6800N, where it complements 0xD course for course. The rest stay
# unnamed, 0xB included -- but 0xB, not 0xD, is the dry dial on the WW6600R
# combo, which carries no 0xD at all, so a gate keyed on 0xD alone silently
# no-ops there. Evidence for all of it in
# docs/investigations/course-option-groups.md.
#
# A kind is not an entity name: dishwashers carry 0xD with no
# supportedDryLevel at all (their dry setting is heated_dry), so callers key
# the mask against their own list rather than assuming what it counts.
#
# Two things a caller cannot infer from the bytes:
#
#   - A mask is what the device advertises, not what it enforces. A WW6500
#     takes only 2-5 rinses on Baby Care -- on its own panel, not just in
#     SmartThings -- where the mask allows all six. Gating on one offers at
#     most a little too much, which the appliance then refuses.
#   - An empty mask is NOT automatically "nothing is selectable". On a
#     dryer's Quick Dry it is, but a washer's cloud Download slot reports
#     empty masks for every kind while still holding live values, because
#     the downloaded program supplies its own. That call is the caller's.

    """Build a SelectDesc `options` callable that narrows a supported<Option>
    list to what the *selected course* actually accepts.

    Without this, a dryer offers every dry level its board supports on every
    course, and the ones the running course rejects are simply ignored by the
    appliance -- no error, no state change, nothing the user can see. Handing
    the entity a narrowed list turns that silent no-op into a visible
    ServiceValidationError from Home Assistant's own option check.

    `kind` is one of the OPTION_KIND_* nibbles above; `field` and
    `options_field` are this entity's live value and its full supported list
    on `href`.

    Three rules, none of which the mask decides on its own:

      - **Never blank the entity.** The result is the decoded set *union the
        live value*: `options` and `current_option` are computed independently
        by select.py, and HA's SelectEntity.state returns None when the
        current option isn't in the list -- so a course change landing before
        the board updates its dryLevel would otherwise read as `unknown`.
      - **Never narrow to empty.** An empty `_raw_options()` is the
        "unpopulated" contract that pairs with exists_fn suppression, and
        these descriptors deliberately have none, so an empty list means a
        live entity with an empty dropdown rather than no entity. No opinion
        from the decoder (`None`) falls back to the full supported list; a
        course that genuinely allows nothing falls back to just the live
        value.
      - **The supported list sets the order**, not the mask, so the dropdown
        doesn't reshuffle as the course changes. A live value the supported
        list omits is appended rather than dropped.

    Two of the module comment's warnings are this caller's to answer, and
    both are answered by offering *more* rather than less -- the mask is
    what the device advertises, not what it enforces, so over-offering costs
    at most a write the appliance refuses, while under-offering makes a
    level the user really can select unreachable through Home Assistant:

      - **An empty mask on the Download course is not "nothing selectable".**
        A cloud slot reports empty masks for every kind while its values stay
        live, because the downloaded program supplies its own. Only a local
        course's empty mask (a dryer's Quick Dry) means what it says.
      - **A one-byte mask cannot address past index 7.** Where the supported
        list is longer, the entries beyond that are unaddressable rather than
        disallowed, so they are kept.

    supportedOptions is a 1-hex-nibble header followed by one fixed-width
    record per selectable course, self-indexed rather than positional --
    the first byte of every record is that course's own hex code.
    Confirmed against six independent real-world dumps: every one divides
    evenly into `header + N * K bytes` with fully unique first bytes across
    all N records, at the record's true byte width.

    K is the width the header states, checked by two conservative guards
    rather than trusted outright: the derived codes must all be distinct,
    and must include whatever course is currently selected. Where the
    header doesn't hold up, the smallest passing K wins instead -- the
    heuristic this fallback shipped with, kept because every course list
    derived so far came out of it. If nothing passes, this returns [].

    The record payload behind those first bytes is decoded by
