"""Hrefs deliberately not modeled as capabilities.

Every entry here is either irrelevant plumbing (network/account/OTA
housekeeping that will never be home-automation-relevant) or a duplicate of
state we already expose through a friendlier href. Declaring them here,
rather than leaving them unregistered, keeps discover()'s unknown-resource
reporting limited to genuine coverage gaps.

Capability defaults entities=() and discover() treats any href that
resolves to a capability at all as matched, even one with no entities, so
this list uses the same declaration shape as a real capability with no
extra machinery. Fold into by_type registries (per-family gap detection)
and into the global ALL list (unknown-device-type fallback).

Deliberately exact hrefs only, no href_prefix/pattern capabilities: the
unknown-device-type fallback path (coordinator's `discover(resources,
CAPABILITIES)` call) doesn't pass pattern_caps, so a prefix-based entry
here would silently do nothing on that path. Enumerate each known href
instead; it's a short, stable list.

This list is maintainer-curated only; there is no per-installation
override. Grow it as real /device/0 dumps surface more universal noise --
never on a guess. If a href's relevance is unclear, leave it unbound so it
surfaces as a gap for a human to look at.
