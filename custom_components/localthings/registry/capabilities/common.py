# section.
#
# UNIVERSAL holds every capability with no known family that both has the
# href and needs to model it some other way.

# its climate entity already owns /power/0 and /power/vs/0 via bare
# no-entity Capability objects (airconditioner.COVERAGE), and a second
# real cap on the same href would make _build() raise (see
# by_type/airconditioner.py). Kids-lock/remote-control have no such
# conflict, so they stay in UNIVERSAL.

# Airconditioner also partially opts out of UNIVERSAL itself: issue #193
# needs ENERGY_METER's cumulativePower scale to differ by board
# generation, so by_type/airconditioner.py excludes just that one member
# and substitutes its own ENERGY_METER_GENERIC/ENERGY_METER_LEGACY.

# keeps. Both sit outside the /device/0 batch on every dump on record, so

# registry.PROBE_HREFS and issue #301.

# firmware's monthly bucket on a fridge, cumulative runtime on an
