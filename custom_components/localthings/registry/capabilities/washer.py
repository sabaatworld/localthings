"""Capabilities specific to washer appliances (Samsung DA_WM_TP1-class
front-load washers).

Resources verified against two live WW90DG6U25LEU4 dumps (Table_02 course
family). Washers share the `DA_WM_` laundry board with dryers, so their
`modelNum` can't tell the two apart -- see `registry/by_type/__init__.py`'s
`_CONSUMER_PREFIX_TO_KEY` for the `description`-based detection this device
type requires.

The shared laundry surface -- power/kids-lock/remote-control OCF+vendor
fallback pairs, buzzer, energy meter, job-beginning-status, and the
/course/vs/0 cycle-select machinery -- lives in laundry.py. Only washer-
specific controls (wash settings, drum-clean tracking, dispenser dosing) are
here; they read washer-only fields off the same shared /course/vs/0 options
array.

# Course_XX hex code labels (translations/en.json,

# rather than guessed: 23 codes from a live WW90DG6U25LEU4's editCourseList,
# matched positionally against a user's app screenshots and the printed
# manual (issue #2); 5 more (Wash+Dry, Air Wash, Cotton Dry, Synthetics Dry,
# a second distinct '1F' Intense Cold) from a WD90T654DBN/S1 combo's own
# editCourseList and screenshots (issue #22, a combo's own course set, not
# implying anything about a plain washer's '1F'); 3 more (Eco Cold, Towels,
# Self Clean+) verified directly on a WF50A8600AV/US by reading back the raw
# code after selecting each cycle on the appliance (issue #80). 2 more
# ('0A' Towels, 'B0' Mixed Load) reported for a WW90DG5G34ABLE on the same
# Table_02 family (issue #363). Several codes legitimately share a label
# across different course tables -- '21'/'65' Colors, '27'/'5E'/'78'
# Rinse+Spin, '0A'/'33'/'54'/'70' Towels -- not typos. (This list said
# "'24' Towels" until issue #343 found 24/33 transposed; 24 is Bedding.)
#
# No static fallback list is kept here: other models have different actual
# course sets, so hardcoding one device's list would show/hide the wrong
# options elsewhere. laundry.cycle_options() reads only the live
# x.com.samsung.da.editCourseList; a device that doesn't populate it gets no
# cycle select at all (see cycle_select's exists_fn). x.com.samsung.da.
# options' MostUsed_* entry was considered as a fallback source (its first
# byte matches the selected Course_XX on both dumps), but the remaining
# bytes don't decode to any confirmed course code, so it isn't used.
#
# The owner of a Korean Table_02 washer confirmed the names for its newer
# 69/6A-79/88 course-code family, including Course_69 as AI Wash. Those names
# live only in the table-scoped translation catalog; a code not confirmed by
# the owner or device metadata falls back to washer_cycle_fallback, which
# surfaces a personal-course name only -- no invented English label for an
# unrecognized standard code (PR #251 review).
#
# washer_cycle_table_00 (issue #357) is a separate, older course-code family
# reported by a WF45R6300AW/US -- confirmed by the reporter selecting each
# cycle on the appliance and reading back the raw code, the same method used
# for Table_02's WF50A8600AV/US codes above. A device reporting Table_00 with
# an unconfirmed code (FlexWash's washer_flexwash_device fixture, for
# instance) still renders that code raw rather than borrowing a Table_02
# label -- the two tables are unrelated code spaces despite a handful of
# overlapping hex values.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# /washer/vs/0 -- wash temperature, spin speed, rinse cycle count, soil level.
# Despite the shared href, this is unrelated to dryer.DRYER_SETTINGS (also
# bound to '/washer/vs/0') -- an artifact of Samsung reusing the same OCF
# path for different device families. Only one of the two ever binds for a
# given device, since dryer and washer are separate by_type registries.
