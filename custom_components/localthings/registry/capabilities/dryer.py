# /course/vs/0 -- cycle selection, shared with washer/dishwasher via
# laundry.cycle_select. Course display names live in translations under
# entity.select.dryer_cycle (Table_03, DV5000-class). Codes '01' Normal and
# '06' Time dry were confirmed on a DVE50A8600V/A3 by selecting each cycle
# on the appliance and reading back the raw code (issue #80); '51' Eco
# Cotton, '53' AI Dry+, and '4e' Self Dry the same way on a DV90DG6845LHU5
# (issue #244). /st/dryercourse/vs/0 re-encodes the same selected course
# and is ignored (ignored.py), mirroring /st/washercourse/vs/0 for washers.
#
# dryer_cycle_table_00 is a separate, older course-code family reported by
# a DVE45R6300W/A3 (issue #357), confirmed the same way: the reporter
# selected each cycle on the appliance and read back the resulting raw
# code. It shares no codes with Table_03 above -- 'a5' Bedding here and
# '01' Normal are both table-scoped, so a Table_03 dryer never picks up a
# Table_00 label or vice versa (see laundry.cycle_select's table_href).
# A DV6800N -- same DA_WM_A51_20_COMMON board, also Table_00 -- confirmed
# 14 more courses the same way (issue #394); its /course/vs/0 supportedOptions
# only advertises a different subset of this same table (each model exposes
# whichever courses its hardware supports), not a conflicting code family --
# the one code both reporters confirmed, 'a5', means Bedding on both. Folded
# into the same catalog entry below rather than a new one.
#
# Drum Clean+ maintenance tracking (issue #258) reuses washer.py's
# DrumCleanProposal_/WashingTimes_/DrumCleanLog_ tokens on this same
# options[] array -- see laundry.drum_clean_cycles_remaining/
# drum_clean_last_cleaned. No separate heat-exchanger-clean tracking was
# found on either dump #258 supplied, so if the app surfaces that reminder,
# it isn't computed from anything this integration can read locally.
# Damp Alert maps to MixedLoadBell; its Enable/Disable vocabulary requires a
# dedicated writer. The per-course bitmap is not confirmed enough to safely
# reject a write, so this control stays ungated.
