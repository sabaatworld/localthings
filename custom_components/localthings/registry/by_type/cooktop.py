"""Cooktop device registry, for everything reporting `oic.d.cooktop`.

Named after the OCF device type rather than a fuel: gas and induction units
alike report it (issues #508, #314). Two board generations sit behind it,
with disjoint resource surfaces, so both capability sets live here and each
binds only on the board that serves its hrefs:

- TP2X and legacy ARTIK051 boards (NA9300K gas, NV9300K/NV8000T induction;
  PR #23) report burner state as strings in /mode/vs/0's options array.
  Read-only: no write contract has been verified for them.
- TP1X_DA-KS-COOKTOP boards (NV8500T, NV9000D; issue #86) serve the range
  combo's /cooktop/status/vs/0 burnerList surface, reused from range.py.

The one href both serve differently is /power/vs/0, split on which surface
the board has.
